Pseudo Code
 1. Prompt user for R/P/S -- look up how to prompt the user
 2. Randomly select a computer R/P/S -- check the bonus from 26
 3. Compare user response to computer selection -- conditional
    look up how to alert user of what is happening
 4. Update and display statistics -- 
    create separate variables (wins, losses, ties)
    create an object (statistics = wins: 0, losses: 0, ties: 0)
 5. Confirm if want to play again
    look up how to confrim this

 I need to use code that I can re-use
    all of my logic is in a FUNCTION

everything will happen in the function
function playGame ( ) {

}

playGame ();
